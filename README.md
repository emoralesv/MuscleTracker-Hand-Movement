# MuscleTracker 

A Surface Electromyography (sEMG) database was acquired from the right arm of 58 healthy subjects without neuromuscular diseases or cardiovascular problems performing five hand movements. The acquisition was performed using two types of amplifiers, a BIOPAC MP36 and a portable device named MuscleTracker.

# Introduction
* This is the database presented in the manuscript "Surface Electromyography Dataset from Different Movements of the Hand using a portable and a non-portable device".
* The code for the experimentation presented in the manuscript is in the folder "Code".
